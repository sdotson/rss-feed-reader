# Offline RSS Feed Reader

This has been built as part of a coding challenge. The purpose is to retrieve the items from an arbitrary RSS feed.

I started it from the react-boilerplate here:
https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git

The following directories/files were changed/created to create this app:
- `server/middlewares/api.js`
- `server/index.js`
- `app/containers/homepage/index.js`
- `components/*`
- `index.html`
- `package.json`

## Get started

`npm install`

`npm run start`
